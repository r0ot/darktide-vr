# The Quest's controller radio, read from the headset's own log.
#
# On 18 September 2026 a worn session was lost to controllers that dropped
# every few seconds, and three wrong answers were given before a headset reboot
# fixed it. What the log had been saying the whole time was that the HEADSET's
# radio coprocessor -- `SyncBossFW`, an nRF reached over SPI, not the
# controllers -- was failing its own register reads. The first of those came
# EIGHTEEN MINUTES before the session became unplayable.
#
# That gap is the whole point of this check. The fault announces itself long
# before it is felt, and the fix is a forty second reboot, so noticing early
# costs nothing and noticing late costs a session.
#
# Facts in, a decision out: the caller pulls the log, this reads it.
#
# The three signatures, in the order they matter:
#
#   Register read failed / Failed to get or set pulsar value
#       The headset cannot talk to its own radio. No controller is involved in
#       that operation, so it cannot be a battery, a range problem or
#       interference. This is the early warning.
#   Got a TX timeout event when no requests were outstanding
#       The radio reporting a timeout for a request that does not exist: a
#       state machine that has lost track of itself.
#   Excessive enumeration duration
#       Enumerating a controller is a millisecond job. It was taking 7.6
#       seconds. On its own this is a symptom of load as well as of a wedge,
#       so it is the weakest of the three and only ever reads as `degrading`.
#
# And the quantitative one, from each disconnect's own counters:
#
#   Disconnected device stats: RSSI=-24, rx=14107, missed=6953
#       Heavy loss at STRONG signal is a degraded link. Weak signal with loss
#       is only range, and a controller put down on a desk reads that way, so
#       the RSSI test is what keeps this from crying wolf every time the
#       headset is taken off. Healthy readings on this rig were 0-2% loss over
#       hundreds of thousands of packets; the bad ones were 24-66%.
