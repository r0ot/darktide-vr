-- Where a world point has to be published so that it lands, in the image the

-- The zoom is the game rendering a narrower cone across the same angle, and
-- the viewer submits the runtime's own field of view unchanged -- that is what
-- makes it a zoom. But it also means anything positioned by the submitted
-- field of view (the reticle quad the runtime composites, or a quad the viewer
-- draws into the eye images) is placed for an image that is not the one being
-- shown: everything off the view's centre has moved outward by the
-- magnification. Moving the published point outward by the same factor cancels
-- it exactly.
--
-- OpenXR axes, -Z forward: the two components across the view scale, the depth
-- does not. The axis is the head's, not each eye's, so the two eyes disagree
-- by (m - 1) times half the IPD -- under 4 mm at a tenth magnification, which
-- is a fiftieth of a degree at ten metres. Pure.
--
-- The RANGE is preserved, and that is not a detail. Scaling the two across
-- components and leaving the depth alone moves the point off the surface it
-- was measured on: aiming down at the ground, the vertical component grows by
-- the magnification and the reticle ends up BELOW the ground plane and further
-- away than the thing it is marking. Worn, 18 September: "if I aim at the
-- ground then ads the cursor appears to be inside the ground -- in any case
-- it's further away than it should be."
--
-- What the correction is for is the ANGLE. The viewer places the reticle at
-- this world point and the runtime projects it, so only the direction decides
-- where it lands; the distance decides where it sits in depth, and that was
-- never the zoom's to change. Scaling the across components turns the ray,
-- then putting the result back to its original length leaves it on the
-- surface. Pure.

-- WHY THE RETICLE SITS TOO FAR AWAY IN THE SIGHTS, and only there.
--
-- The aim zoom renders the world through a narrowed frustum while the viewer
-- submits the field of view UNCHANGED -- "which is what makes it a zoom"
-- (zoomed_frustum, and the comment at its call site). Every angle from the
-- view axis in the rendered world is therefore multiplied by the
-- magnification, and so is the disparity between the two eyes. A point at
-- true range D has disparity proportional to IPD/D; multiplied by m it reads
-- as IPD/(D/m). The world in the sights appears at D/m.
--
-- The reticle does not. It is an OpenXR quad layer at a true world pose,
-- which the runtime composites through the SUBMITTED field of view -- the
-- unnarrowed one. So the world comes forward by m and the reticle stays put,
-- and the reticle reads as m times further than the thing it marks.
--
-- That is why the error is proportional to the distance aimed rather than a
-- fixed offset (user, 19 September) and why it is not there outside the
-- sights, which is the fact that named it. And it is why six candidates
-- inside the reticle path were each ruled out by measurement: the fault is
-- RADIAL, and `magnified_target` above renormalises to `before` -- it
-- preserves the range by construction and could never have corrected a depth.
-- It is the angular half of the correction; this is the radial half.
--
-- Returns the range to place the reticle at so it verges where the magnified
-- world puts the surface. Pure.
